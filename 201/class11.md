## Video and Audio Content

Explain how the ability to use video and audio on the web has evolved since the early 2000s.

	It has changed in a pretty massive way. When it was first introduced the big plugin based technologies had security and accessibility snags and now we can seamlessly add videos from YouTube and such while not bogging down the computers storage/memory.

Describe the use of the src and controls attributes in the < video > element.

	 the src (source) attribute contains a path to the video you want to embed. It works in exactly the same way as the img. 
    As read on developer.mozilla.org 

Why is it important to have fallback content inside the <  video > element?

	It is important because if a browser getting the page doesn’t support	your  < video > element it will provide something for old browsers. It allows a user using any browser access.  

Write a very short story where < audio > and < video > are characters.

	There once was a world where people felt short on time. The people of this world spent so much of it reading to rhyme. In a land far far off there was a duo of two that knew together they could change this world that was so far off. They worked strong and well together. The mission was simple. Let them have more time. Let the people of the world still learn and grow but let us give them a show. Let these people really get in the know. No more reading just to rhyme. Yes, let them have more time.  So these two, who go by Audio and Video, set out to the far far off world .  Video, to be seen. Audio, to be heard. Together they shook things up. Shared their mission and never gave up.  Thanks to them, we all have this power! Thank you, Thank you dearest Video and Audio!  

## A Complete Guide To Grid

How does Grid layout differ from Flex?

	Grid and flexbox. The basic difference between CSS Grid Layout and CSS Flexbox Layout is that flexbox was designed for layout in one dimension - either a row or a column. Grid was designed for two-dimensional layout - rows, and columns at the same time. 
    As stated on 
https://developer.mozilla.org › ... › CSS › CSS Grid Layout

Grid container, grid item, and grid line are a few important terms to understand when using Grid. Please describe these terms in a few sentences.

	Grid Container - Grid containers consist of grid items, placed inside columns and rows. Via w3schools.

	Grid item - This is what is inside the container. 

	Grid line -  Grid lines are created when you define tracks in the explicit grid using CSS Grid Layout. Via developer.mozilla.org/ 

## Responsive Images

Besides making a site visually appealing across different screen sizes, why should developers make images responsive?

	Having responsive images is important because it helps us deliver optimal file size, the right image for the right screen size, improves user experience and improves loading time. Having various versions of your image is important for creating a responsive image. Found on https://www.lab21.gr

Define the following < img > attributes srcset and sizes. Write an example of how they are used.

	The srcset is a list of sources.
	The sizes are the different options it has based on the display being used. 
	An example is I can get on a streaming service from my  my phone, laptop, or go to the theater and the content is the same but the image size and resolution change depending on when I am on it. 

How is srcset more helpful for responsive images than CSS or JavaScript?

	Using the srcset attribute has made responsive image sizing much simpler. It allows you to define a list of differently-sized versions of the same image. As said on https://html.com/attributes/img-srcset/

    Do we want to use srcset from this point on?
