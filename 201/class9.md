## Html Forms

1. ***Why are forms so important in web development?***

	Understanding the people who are using your site allows you to collect data that may be helpful or can allow the user to have more control about what they excperience.

***When designing a form, what are some key things to keep in mind when it comes to user experience?***

Keep it short and simple.  
Ask only what is necessary.   
Avoid error frustration of the user. 
Order form field from easy to hard.
Distinguish between optional and required text. 

***List 5 form elements and explain their importance.***. 

As seen on w3school.com.  
< form >	Defines an HTML form for user input 


< input > Defines an input control 

< textarea >Defines a multiline input control (text area) . 

< label >Defines a label for an < input > element 

< fieldset >Groups related elements in a form 

< legend >	Defines a caption for a < fieldset > element 

< select >	Defines a drop-down list

## Learn JS

***How would you describe events to a non-technical friend?***

	An event is an action that takes place when a user interacts with a program. Best said by the people at techtarget.com 

***When using the addEventListener() method, what 2 arguments will you need to provide?***

	- The first parameter is the type of the event (like " click " or " mousedown " or any other HTML DOM Event.). 
    - The second parameter is the function we want to call when the event occurs. Again, I found this info on w3schools.com

***Describe the event object. Why is the target within the event object useful?***

	The event object contains a number of properties that describe the event that occurred. The target event property returns the element that triggered the event. ... Return Value: A reference to the object on which the event originally occured.

***What is the difference between event bubbling and event capturing?***

	With bubbling, the event is first captured and handled by the innermost element and then propagated to outer elements. With capturing, the event is first captured by the outermost element and propagated to the inner elements.

## Things I found neat or want to know more about….

	When did we start collecting users info? What kinds of website do we want to use a form for? How can we save the input or where do we store it or is it stored on the site?
