This is important because we will inevitably have to troubleshooter debug and having an understanding of the key concepts and resources will allow us to have autonomy or be able to target the problem with some insight. 

## What Went Wrong? Troubleshooting JavaScript.

***Name some key differences between a Syntax Error and a Logic Error.***

	A syntax error is an error made in the source code by the programmer, whereas a logical error is an error that causes the program to produce incorrect results.
    * Syntax errors: These are spelling errors in your code that actually cause the program not to run at all, or stop working part way through — you will usually be provided with some error messages too. These are usually okay to fix, as long as you are familiar with the right tools and know what the error messages mean!
    * Logic errors: These are errors where the syntax is actually correct but the code is not what you intended it to be, meaning that program runs successfully but gives incorrect results. These are often harder to fix than syntax errors, as there usually isn't an error message to direct you to the source of the error.
As stated by MDN. 

***List a few types of errors that you have encountered in past lab assignments and explain how you were able to correct them.***

	I have encountered syntax errors mostly. Like adding a space where I didn’t need one. Not having a space where one was needed. I think I encounter	most of my logic errors	 so far in css because ill do something to influence a space but if it isn’t what I want it is wrong it is just not my desired result 

***How will this topic continue to influence your long term goals?***

	Knowing what kind of error I am dealing with allows me to address it in a meaningful way. This topic will save me time and allow me to be an effective and desirable Dev.


## The JavaScript Debugger.

***How would you describe the JavaScript Debugger tool and how it works to someone just starting out in software development?***

	A debugger is a software tool that can help the software development process by identifying coding errors at various stages of the operating system or application development.

***Define what a breakpoint is.***

Places where code execution can be stopped. Used to examine variables while the code is executing.

***What is the call stack?***

	The call stack is a mechanism for an interpreter (like the JavaScript interpreter in a web browser) to keep track of its place in a script that calls multiple functions — what function is currently being run and what functions are called from within that function, etc.
Best said by the hard workers over at MDN.
