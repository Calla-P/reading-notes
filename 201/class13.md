##  Local Storage and How To Use It On Websites

***Why would a developer use local storage for a web application?***

	Local storage allows developers to store and retrieve data in the browser. The data stored in local storage will not expire. This means the data will persist even if the tab or the browser window is closed. From www.section.io

***What information should not be stored in local storage?***

	Sensitive information like passwords or personal information

***Local storage can store what type of data? How would you convert it to that type before storing?***

	string data for its key and value.Values can be explicitly converted to strings by calling either String() or n. toString() . With the String() function, let's convert a Boolean value to a string by passing the value true into the parameters for String() . When we do this, the string literal "true" will be returned.

## Things I want to know more about

	Local storage is neat. How do cookies get involved? Which websites use it? Or is this just young buck stuff to be able to wrap our minds about storage.
