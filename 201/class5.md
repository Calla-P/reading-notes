This topic matters to me because images are used often, very very often, and knowing how to get those in  smoothly and with the quickness. Css is where we can make our design shine. Understanding how to get things to flow will bring users back. 

## Using Images in Html

***What is a real world use case for the alt attribute being used in a website?***

	Id want to use alt in order to create access to the purpose of the image for people who are sight impaired or do not have access to the images shown on the page. 

***How can you improve accessibility of images in an HTML document?***

	-Avoid text in images.  
	- if the image is decorative still provide alt text = “ “.  
	-convey image to all types of users by adding alt text and a title for the image. 

***Provide an example of when the figure element would be useful in an HTML document.***

	It is useful to single out an image that is not placement specific. So in your text you can reference see Figure 1 and the user will know to look for an image with a caption on the page without disturbing your flow. It creates opportunity to move the image without a complete redesign. 

***Describe the difference between a gif image and an svg image, pretend you are explaining to an elder in your community.***

	A gif and and a svg  are  ways to display an image	. Think of a gif like looking through binoculars. You focus on what you want to see but if you play with the zoom spinwheel gear thing what you saw clearly will get blurry and a svg is like wearing prescription glasses. No matter what you look at,  close or far, you will see just as clearly. 

***What image type would you use to display a screenshot on your website and why?***

	PNG: This format is preferred for screenshots and other types of imagery where there's not a lot of color data.

## Learn CSS

1. ***Describe the difference between foreground and background colors of an HTML element, pretend you are talking to someone with no technical knowledge.***

	The difference between these two is kinda what you see first and what is behind it. Think of it like the difference between what you say and what you think.

***Your friend asks you to give his colorless blog website a touch up. How would you use color to give his blog some character?***

	You can use color to direct readers to what is important and keep a good flow. You can match the colors with the vibe of the blog. 

***What should you consider when choosing fonts for an HTML document?***

	- Are they web safe?

***What do font-size, font-weight, and font-style do to HTML text elements?***

	- font weight will make you will determine how bold or light your text appears
	- font-size determines how large or small. 
	- font style is the cute bit that give pizzazz

***Describe two ways you could add spacing around the characters displayed in an h1 element.***

	- text-align: justify **makes the text spread out.**. 
	- letter-spacing  **allows spacing between letters**. 
	- word spacing   **allows spacing between words**.
