# Class 3

This matters because we are learning styling, how to ask user questions. 

## Learn HTML

**When should you use an unordered list in your HTML document?**

    They are used to make a list of related items, in no particular order.  

**How do you change the bullet style of unordered list items?**

    list-style-position: outside;

**When should you use an ordered list vs an unordered list in your HTML document?**

    You use an ordered list when you need to create a list of related items in a specific order and an unordered list when the order doesn’t  matter.

**Describe two ways you can change the numbers on list items provided by an ordered list?**

    type=“ ”, start= “ ”

## Learn CSS

**Describe the CSS properties of margin and padding as characters in a story. What is their role in a story titled: “The Box Model”?**

>>***The Box Model***

>>***Three people “properties” walk into a bar named “ Ole Boxey “ Paddy the padding walks in first, Brody  the Border, second, and Marge the Margin third. Just so happens there was a speed dating event. For this night, they must engage with the cuties “the content” in the same order that they walked in. They go  table to table in the same way. They find this works really well for them and forever after decide to stay in this way.*** 

**List and describe the four parts of an HTML elements box as referred to by the box model.**

    Content - text, image, video,  
    Padding -   an area around content ; transparent  
    Border - a border goes around the content and padding  
    Margin - clears an area of space outside the border, it’s transparent

## Learn JS

**What data types can you store inside of an Array?**

    Primitive data types - integers, characters, float 
     Non-primitive - objects

**Is the people array a valid JavaScript array? If so, how can I access the values stored? If not, why?**

    No, it is not. Too many brackets

**List five shorthand operators for assignment in javascript and describe what they do.**

    Addition - x = f(  )
    Subtraction - x-= f(  )
    Multiplication - x-= f(  )
    Division - x /= f(  )
    Remainder - x%= f(  )

**Read the code below and evaluate the last expression and explain what the result would be and why.**

    The expression evaluates to 10dag.
    A is 10. C = 0 cause it’s false. Be is dog so (a +c)+b;

**Describe a real world example of when a conditional statement should be used in a JavaScript program.**

    To play question games.

**Give an example of when a Loop is useful in JavaScript.**
