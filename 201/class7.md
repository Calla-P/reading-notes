# Class 07

**This is helpful because tables can bring clarity for business purposes, Constructors allow for time saving and Dry code. Knowing what your prototype will inherit allows for clarity when creating the constructor.**

## Domain Modeling

***Explain why we need domain modeling.***

	Because communication is key, we need Domain Modeling to conceptualize a specific issue and have language to describe it between technical personnel and business teams. It allows for clarity and targeted solutions. 

## HTML Table Basics

***Why should tables not be used for page layouts?***

	It doesn’t look good, It disrupts the way a page loads, it confuses the Search engine Optimization, screen readers are adverse. 

***List and describe 3 different semantic HTML elements used in an HTML < table >.***

	An HTML table consists of one <table> element and one or more < tr >, < th >, and < td > elements.  
The < tr > element defines a table row. 
the < th > element defines a table header. 
the < td > element defines a table cell as sited on w3schools.com

## Introducing Constructors

***What is a constructor and what are some advantages to using it?***

	A constructor is a special type of member function. It calls on itself, when an object is created.Multiple ways to initialize objects according to the number of arguments passes while declaration. The objects of child class can be initialized by the constructors of base class as stated on stackoverflow.com

***How does the term this differ when used in an object literal versus when used in a constructor?***

	Objects created using object literal are singletons, this means when a change is made to the object, it affects the object entire the script. 

	Well, when you only have to create a single object literal, it's not so useful. But if you create more than one, the THIS inside the constructor  enables you to use the same method definition for every object you create.

## Object Prototypes Using A Constructor

***Explain prototypes and inheritance via an analogy from your previous work experience.***

	Refers to a prototypes that is very complex feels like magic. 

	Anytime that I have taken a new position for massage therapy [ the prototype ] I inherit a room, table, sheets, shea butter, and wall charts, typical a muscle wall chart,  to work with.  These things are only relevant to the massage therapy work. In the past when I managed an indoor garden I was not given a room, table, oils, sheets. In that position I was given a team, sharp scissors, ideal schedule for plant care, priority list, and deadlines. These are inherent to just the prototype of what space I am working and the proper ruler of engagement.  

### Thing to know more about

Are there better ways to create a table like entity without making a table because it seems taboo to actual create one but maybe it is just taboo to use it as a layout for a webpage
