## Learn CSS - Flexbox

1. ***Flexbox is designed for one-dimensional content. Explain what this means.***

	Being one-dimensional, it only deals with layout in a single direction - columns or rows - at a time. This works well for smaller layouts, such as components best said from the peeps at wearediagram.com

***Explain the difference between the main axis and cross axis.***

	The cross axis runs perpendicular to the main axis, therefore if your flex-direction (main axis) is set to row or row-reverse the cross axis runs down the columns. If your main axis is column or column-reverse then the cross axis runs along the rows. I found this at developer.mozilla.org

***How can using certain properties of flexbox negatively impact accessibility?***

	The flexbox just adjust things visually so if you use row reverse or column reverse it won’t play nice with screen readers or people just using the keyboard to get around your page. 

## CSS Layout - Flexbox

***What are some advantages of using flexbox over float?***

	- Flexbox is responsive and mobile-friendly.  
	 - Flex container's margins do not collapse with the margins of its content.  
	- We can easily change the order of elements on our webpage without even making changes in HTML as stated from the helpful folx @ geeksforgeeks 

***How does this topic connect with your long term goals?***

	This topics connects with my long term goals because it is important to be able to build web, phone, and accesible friendly tools from the jump. Having a dynamic page hold the attention of users and may get them to visit a site again and again because of the ease and use. This requires planning and having a solid understand of what tools do which task best now and forever more. 

## Things I want to know more about

	- Are there tools to play with different versions of the same site. Like modeling a project one way versus another?  
    
    - How many hours does it take to have a solid understanding of accessibility mixed with fluid design concepts and understanding of tools that could work for a certain function. I’d imagine reddit and google are probably the go-to ways.
