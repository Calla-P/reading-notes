# CSS Intro! 

## Let’s get stylish!

**CSS** is the decoration of your index of your HTML file kind of lays on top it’s like your outfit so speak.  

*I would say it’s like the jazzy fizzle of the website.  
Cascading style sheets or CSS as we know it it allows for extra features to stand out*.  

> *Personal thoughts*: **CSS**, you are affecting the visual effects. It is tailoring your outfit.  
The idea is to enhance what you have to attract actions you desire for comfort, ease, and flow.  

    - HTML is your foundation. Your bones, muscles, skin, and fluids so speak. 
    - In this metaphor, CSS  is your clothes, your decorations, your adornments. The sunglasses , t-shirt, pants, watch, hat, laptop. It is external that relies on the body to make it fit. 
    - Java which is next is what you do with your actions, do you play sports, do you ride bikes so to speak. So beyond that tangent so we’re gonna go back to CSS

There’s gonna be some styles that you know by heart because you will use them so often but **CSS** has so *many* options. It will be ***imperative*** that you have a resource that you feel comfortable with using.
Such as [W3 school](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_float.asp)  

For our notes today we are just going to focus on the color and position for your page.  

**CSS** uses documents to present it to work. A document is usually a text file. We’re gonna be using HTML.  

**CSS** is used for basic document text styling 
    - For example is changing the color, changing the size, turning a single column into a Layout, and even a little animation. 

**CSS** is a rule based language and to be real honest there’s a secret society called the **CSS Working Group** that has the ability to add new features and they do that based on like development demands or sometimes even big companies can speak to why they might need a certain feature and they will consider it.regardless, it is rule based meaning that you have to select what you’re working on and then work within its properties.  

The most common delimeters that will be used are going to be your angle bracket <></> {} to the note where you will be working in reference to the HTML document and then your curly braces to denote the start as far as like color size with length height.

## There are browser defaults with CSS that will allow you to seamlessly incorporate.

The most important for this will be understanding how to check and write to make changes to the element you desire to jazz up!  

You write to it with selectors and brackets.
Selector in where on the page.  
*Per previous metaphor. The selector says arm, leg, head, foot*.  

The brackets  { }  
    indicate the what " style "
    like short pants, blue socks, gold watch  
}  
Last and always last ; semi colin  

Selector {
Property: Value; 
} 

H1{
Color: Red;
Text: Align-center;
}
 That is the basic set up for most CSS. 

To Link you must do 
< link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css"/>
*This example is missing a space after the first angular bracket so that you may see it.  
Once you have created a stylesheet.css.  

That says add style here.
