# Want to build a site from sratch?

## Then lets talk html. 
We will be discussing 
- wire frame and design.  
- Mozilla HTML
- Semantics

Lightly we will cover 
- Mozilla HTML Docs 
- Mozilla HTML Elements


# Step One: Wire Frame your future work. 

### Make the map, muthatrucker.  

    Okay, So Wire Framing basically is getting your plan together before you work. It gives insight to how a user interacts with interface and allows for clarity in priority in the early stage.  

You can do a wire framing by paper, apps, or tools found on the internet. You decide whis approach based on project demands.  

[Wire Frames](https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/ux-design/free-wireframing-tools/) are meant to be clear not fancy or dolled up. It answers :
- who is the audience?
- what is the desired outcome?
- where does it happen? 

Key Concepts - 
- Keep it simple
- Mind the users flow 
- Be clear

# Step 2: HTML 

This is the markup language we will use to to influence our work. Most openers have closers, you will have content, that content might have an image or a link and we will explore the inner workings as we build it out.  
        * When learning. It is in the details so look away a nd look again. 

# Semantics: 

The [semantics](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Semantics) tell your computer what to do by hugging it with its meaning. We will be communicating with our system with html. They will accept semantics so we learm semantics. The very descriptive word or symbol that 'wraps' hugs the text and shares meaning. 

There are over 100 meanings or **semantic elements**


Here are a few:

- < aside>
- < details>
- < figcaption>
- < figure>
- < footer>
- < header>
- < main>
- < mark>
- < nav>
- < section>
- < summary>
- < time>  
       ^Just about there is a space that makes this invalid or it would be meaningful to my system.  
       **Remember space and spaces hold meaning**.
