### Overveiw

Today we are going to talk about basic syntax. What is syntax you ask?    
Simply put it is the way we type to talk to the computer software so it gives us something structured and easy to engage with. 

*We want to be on the same page in order to find the thing we may need to influence in the future*.

We are starting with **Markdown**  

 - I believe markdown is sort of a sophisticated version of html. 

- Markdown is a foundation for software developers, what we cover today will be the base that we build upon.  
  - *Note* It will feel direct and efficient once practiced.  

## Next, lets engage with *delimiters*!

  These *Delimiters* are the symbols we type at the beginning, middle, or end of text and other content.  

## Create headings with '###" pound sign

  **Get Bold** with ** asteriks  
  *Do one* * at the beginning and end of text without a space to get *italics*.
  ***Three of these *** and you'll get ***bold italics***.

 > Then we have things she has said here. We do this > so we can in a fancy way "blockquote" what other peoples thoughts are and quote she/them/him for proper zest and adoration.  
 > >"It's not that I'm so smart, it's just that I stay with problems longer." - Albert Einstein
