# Git Intro: Class Three Notes 

## P.s Please have an understanding of Terminal (Mac) or Command Line 

**To Start lets talk savers**.  
We will call them controls but basically they are the data base that hold our projects.

**First we History**  
Let us talk about the progression of controls. 

### History

***Version Control***

Its purpose to minimize the mistakes made by protecting the versions or stories. 

***Local Version***  
One database on your personal hard disk that stores changes to file

***Centralized Version Control System***

Everyone on a project would have access to one single server that stores group changes allowing for delegation of revision privleges

- Caution if file is corrupted or lost without backup you can loose all the work.

### ***Distributed Version Control*** 

### ***We use ths, because sharing is caring***

Invented to address the major vulnerability in CVS.
DVCS Itâ€™s job is to prevent the potential for dramatic loss by allowing mirrored repositories. 
These data backups can be placed on the server to prevent loss. 

- DVS allows for programmers who are  collaborating to complete a joint project.
- Simatameous workflow can be enabled with DVCS

## Back to the buisness of it all.

## Git
## What is it?

It can be a memory storage.

Git = DVCS  
It has many features we will cover here so buckle up.

*Note*: Commit equals Save 
Snap Shots

  **Like Kassie said during the class, Git stores data and can hold versions of projects in time like a picture**.  
Local Operation  - allowing speed because what we need can be found locally.  
Tracking changes - git tracks every change.  
 If  **you commit**
 **git will treat you sweet**!  
*Git* can detect file coruption or loss of info. 
Loss of Data
States

- Committed - secure local daatabase 

- Modified - file changed but not commited 

- Staged  - It has been flagged to be commited because of changes made in the code.

## Github -  Sharing is Caring 

- **Github can be storage**  
- **Not Git**

- **Share code**
- **online place to store code**
- ***It partners with **GIT** to mange group contributions***.  
It does this with time logged version tracking and changes reveiw.
