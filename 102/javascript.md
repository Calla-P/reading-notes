# Java Script 

## JavaScript is different than job in Java  

## JavaScript is a lightweight interpreted or just in time compiled programming with first class functions.  

It is commonly known for scripting webpages.
JavaScript traditionally is used inside web browsers like Mozilla Firefox, chrome. Safari. Typically you will see JavaScript on the browser, professionally we call this client side.  
*When writing in JavaScript it will have three major components*.

1). One is a text editor or IDE. We will be working with visual studio code

2.) Two Decide whether you are going to embed meaning put it inside HTML or include which means you’ll create a separate JavaScript file and write a line making them together. To get that included you to angular in brackets and write/type  < script>.
<\script> Close them brackets.

3.) Three input and output.  
    - first thing we need to learn is how to interact with JavaScript code. 
    - Something that seems important is console.l og this is how we can print out like debugging information. *which as a noob will be important*.  

It is a good programming practice to declare all variables at the end of a script.

**Data types**:
String, number, boolean  

What is variable?
 It holds data  
    - can be changed, just like in algebra.  

What does it mean to declare a variable?  
Give it value!  

**Const x; declares value.  
Const x = 4 Declares variable and assign it a variable.  

Four ways to declare a variable  
VAR -  used 2015 and before.  
Let Dash can be changed reason reassigned.  
Const < doesn’t change  

I cannot have two variables with the same name.

*If it’s a variable that will never change some thing like A name it will be a constant*.

If it’s some thing that’s going to change it will be a variable.  

*Why do we need variables in the first place*JavaScript allows us to add action and interaction.  

Variable will hold data.  

Use prompt to grab some input from the user.
