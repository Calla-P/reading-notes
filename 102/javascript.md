Java Script 

JavaScript is different than job in Java. 

JavaScript is a lightweight interpreted or just in time compiled programming with first class functions. 

It is commonly known for scripting webpages.
JavaScript traditionally is used inside web browsers like Mozilla Firefox, chrome. Safari. Typically you will see JavaScript on the browser, professionally we call this client side. When writing in JavaScript it will have three major components 

1). One is a text editor or IDE. We will be working with visual studio code

2.) Two Decide whether you are going to embed meaning put it inside HTML or include which means you’ll create a separate JavaScript file and write a line making them together. To get that included you to angular in brackets and write/type vscript. Close them brackets.

3.)Three input and output first thing we need to learn is how to interact with JavaScript code we are going to do that or I guess the most simple way to do that is by using an alert function. Though we will not use the alert. 
Something that seems important is console. Log this is how we can print out like debugging information which as a noob will be important.

It is a good programming practice to declare all variables at the end of a script.

Data types: 
String, number, boolean 

What is variable?
 It holds data 
    - can be changed, just like in variable 

What does it mean to declare a variable? Give it value
Const x; declares value 
Const x = 4 Claire variable and assign it a variable.


Four ways to declare a variable 
VAR -  used 2015 and before. Let Dash can be changed reason reassigned. Const < doesn’t change 

I cannot have two variables with the same name.

If it’s a variable that will never change some thing like Annette. A name.

If it’s some thing that’s going to change it will be lit.

Why do we need variables in the first place? JavaScript allows us to add action and interaction. Period.

Variable will hold data
