## What we will cover  

1. Refactor the previous day's code, using functions.
    * Give a clear definition of refactoring.
    * test if changes are working.

*I still dont know what code snippet(s) in JavaScript*?

## Why we use functions in java?

You can reuse code: Define the code once, and use it many times.

You can use the same code many times with different arguments, to produce different results.
*What is a function*?  

-A function is used to avoid repetitive code.
Just DRY - Don’t repeat yourself.  

It allows for less repetition to  Increase flow and save time.  

*How do we do this*?

* Wrapping sets of code into a command. We call that invoking and it will run through those steps to follow the command.  

* You can create sets to do anything that you want them to.  

***Facts about functions***.  
    -You create the name of function  
         *No spaces
         * second word is capital
        Your function needs a return message

### Returns and Invoking  

* A return statement simply states what do you want to receive back.

*How would you invoke functions*?  

With an return statement / invoke/ “call”  

**My example**:  
Function askFresh(){
Return message;

};

* Functions are placed in shell.
Two word Second word starts with a capital.

* Then we have the parentheses. () The parentheses give us parameters.  

* What goes inside the ()/parameters of your function are argument.  

1. Before you invoke your function the parentheses there give it the parameters. 
2. When you invoke your function the parentheses there are called arguments.
**Arguments are your return**

***So to check if it works, you check the console and do a status check***.
