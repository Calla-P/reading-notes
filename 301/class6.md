## This is important because knowing how to build an API allows us to store data in a more efficient way  

### An Introduction to Node.js on sitepoint.com  

***What is node.js?***

Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a web browser. It allows developers to run JavaScript on the server side to create server-side and networking applications. It uses the V8 JavaScript engine, which is the same engine that runs JavaScript in Google Chrome. Node.js provides an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, which makes it lightweight and efficient for real-time applications. It is commonly used for creating web servers, building APIs, and creating command-line tools.

***In your own words, what is Chrome’s V8 JavaScript Engine?***

This is a JavaScript engine developed for Google Chrome. It is written with an open source and C++. It compiles the code. 

***What does it mean that node is a JavaScript runtime?***

A runtime is a program that runs other programs. In the context of Node.js, a JavaScript runtime refers to the environment in which JavaScript code can be executed outside of a web browser.

***What is npm?***

(Node Package Manager) is the default manager for javascript runtime environment. It is created to make things easier and more shareable for developers.

***What version of node are you running on your machine?***

v19.3.0

***What version of npm are you running on your machine?***

npm: '9.2.0'

***What command would you type to install a library/package called ‘jshint’?***

npm install jshint

***What is node used for?***

It seems very versatile. It can be used for building web servers and web applications, as well as for creating command-line tools and other scripts.

### 6 Reasons for Pair Programming

***What are the 6 reasons for pair programming?***

1. Increased productivity: Pair programming allows for the sharing of ideas and knowledge, which can lead to faster problem-solving and increased productivity.
2. Improved code quality: Two sets of eyes on the code can help catch errors and improve overall code quality.
3. Enhanced learning: Pair programming allows for the sharing of skills and knowledge, which can enhance learning for both individuals.
4. Greater collaboration: Pair programming encourages collaboration and communication, which can lead to better teamwork and a more positive work environment.
5. Faster knowledge transfer: In pair programming, one member of the team can explain the code to the other, which can result in faster knowledge transfer.
6. Risk reduction: Pair programming can help to reduce the risk of project failure by catching errors and bugs early on, and by providing an extra set of eyes to review the code.

***In your experience, which of these reasons have you found most beneficial?***

Faster knowledge transfer, it has helped me to hear someone else share how they are understanding the task at hand just to be able to see things from multiple perspectives. It is also nice to feel heard in my understanding and can boost my confidence. 

***How does pair programming work?***

Typically you have the driver and navigator. One is physically typing the code while the other is giving direction for the person who is physically driving.
