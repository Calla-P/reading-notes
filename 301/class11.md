This is important because understanding the best ways to work with data is important.

**nosql vs sql**

***Fill in the chart below with five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:*** 
	SQL	                    NoSQL
Relational/Tabular - Non-Relational/Multiple Types
Rigid/Fixed Schema - Dynamic/Flexible Schema
ACID Compliance: Yes - ACID Compliance: No/Limited
Only vertical/ horizontal scalability - Unlimited Scalability
Structured Language - No standard query language, different databases use different methods

	***What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?***

	In general, if the data can be easily organized into tables with defined relationships between them, an SQL database is a good fit.

***Give a real world example.***

1. Financial data with multiple relationships between entities (e.g., customers, orders, payments)
2. Human resources data with many-to-many relationships (e.g., employees, departments, projects)
3. Inventory management systems with large amounts of transactional data
4. E-commerce systems with a large amount of catalog data and orders
5. Healthcare systems with patient data and medical records

***What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?***

	In general, if the data is complex and does not fit well into a fixed table structure, a NoSQL database may be a better choice.

***Give a real world example.***

1. Big data with high velocity, volume, and variety
2. Social media data with user-generated content (e.g., posts, comments, likes)
3. Real-time data from devices and sensors
4. Location-based data from mobile apps
5. Content management systems with large amounts of multimedia data


***Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?***

	For hierarchical data storage, a NoSQL database is often a better choice

***Which type of database is best for scalability?***

	For applications with very large data sets or very high traffic, NoSQL databases are often the better choice for scalability. However, for smaller applications or applications with more moderate scaling requirements, either an SQL or a NoSQL database may be a good fit.

**sql vs nosql (Video)**

***What does SQL stand for?***

	Structured Query Language

***What is a relational database?***

	A data base that works with certain assumptions or in a certain way it typically works with tables- or data bin. 

***What type of structure does a relational database work with?***

 	It typically works with tables- data bin/storage containers, fields, ids.

***What is a ‘schema’?***

	They are fields that determine with precision what data does where id, name, price description

***What is a NoSQL database?***

    It stores a humongous amount of data with documnets.

***How does it work?***

	We have a databases with collections, different schemas, and no schema forced.

***What is inside of a MongoDB database?***

	Collections, No/few relations, Fields with less structure.

***Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.***

	MongoDB

***What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?***

	You may have some duplicated data, if you have to update things it can be lots of writing in several different locations
