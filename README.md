# **Growth Mindset**

  ### *Do you believe people can change?*
  ### *Do you believe you can change?*
  ### *What will be created to afford these changes?*
  
  
  
  Hello, My name is Paula. I live in Tacoma, Wa. I am 27 years young, Costa Rican, queer, and motivated to see this through. I interpeurt the growth mindset as a filter in which my life can play out. The growth mindset states that the way you think about the effort you put into things or stress you experience can shape the life you get to lead. 
  <br>
  Your mindset is your internal story as stated in 
  *[The Happiness Lab](https://www.pushkin.fm)*.
  <br>
  >> If you can change people's internal story, you can really change their behavior in profound ways like reducing agression.
    
 To futher expand the growth mindset says to me "I am becasue I do." It is acting on my growing beliefs. Putting effort in, sharing ideas, being curious, feeling resourced, courageous enough to ask, and seeking other growth people for support will and does make a difference in my manifested potential and quality of life. Believeing I can grow and acting on that allows me to enjoy the effort that creates personal and communal progress.
 For awareness, One alternative to a growth mindset is a fixed mindset which for me sounds like "I am not because I tried and look where that got me. Confused." The fixed mindset takes the perspective of I was born this way, I was made this way, and my effort can't change the world or my wolrd. It is what is always was, ya know. Fixed mindsets can come from a place of fear. The fear of being left out or seen as undeserving. It's like a short term protection strategy. Fixed mindset is afraid to find out how hard I'll will have to try. Fixed mindset is a afraid that the effort I render will be the proof you need to pronounce me lame, stupid, or disfunctional. Fixed mindset says "*I'd rather not know. I really rather them not know, too. So imma be quiet and see if I can be forgotten. Let my ignorance be my bliss, take no risk, and watch as these ole life patterns play out*." To live out a life of self doubts. 
    
    
    I personally want to stay in the growth minsdset side of life. So how will I prepare?
