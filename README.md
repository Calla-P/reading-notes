# Greetings

  My name is Paula. I live in Tacoma, Wa. I am 27 years young, Costa Rican, queer, a jack of all and a licensed massage therapist for 6 years. I am determined to learn the badass skill of software development with Code Fellows. I feel grateful for the opportunity to learn with such diverse and determined people. I enjoy pineapples, camping on the beach, and I swear on buttery toast, one day I really will ask that cute barista if they want to go for a walk. lol

  Here is a collection of my learning notes. Thank you for your precious time and sip your water for me! :)
