# Text Editors by Paula Davidson



## What are they?

Well I’d say it is a way to **edit**, **personalize**, and **automate your code**. As a newb in this development field it will be a very important tool. 

*Does it ultimately matter which text editor you use*?  
No, it does not. Many people do have a preference.

*If you are coding, will you want to use a text editor*?  
Yes. 

*Why?*  
It will allow you to get to your desired out put with more efficiency and clarity.


*Do text editors help insure you are making proper form and following the building rules?*    
Yes

It is believed that one finds their text editor when they have completed a project  that they feel is up to snuff.   
...
It is also believed that it will then become your go to tool. 

From what I read the most important features to have in your text editor  are:

>  1. code completion: kinda finishes the sentences you start. Like predictive closing bracket 
>  2. syntax highlighting: color coding your elements 
>  3. a nice variety of themes (to reduce eye strain and fatigue)
>  4. the ability to choose from a healthy selection of extensions available when you need them 
>   
>   ***Fun Fact***: most developers use dark backgrounds with light text for eye ease. 


### **So what is even out there?**

First, know that there is a text editor that comes with each computer system like Mac or Windows or whatever program you are using.  
From what I read they are basic basic basic. It doesn’t sound the best but in a pinch could do the do. Be thoughtful in your choice. 

Do look into third party text editors like:    
Notepad++, Text Wrangler, BB Edit, Visual Studio Code, Atom, Brackets, and Sublime Text.
These text editors can all be downloaded and installed to your computer from their respective websites.

We will use **Visual Studio Code** because it is compatible and offers features like everything:

syntax highlighting, themes, extensions and code completion.
